# Multi-hop-GNN
A graph neural network model for building functional classification. Multi-hop GNN enhances the modeling capability of long-range dependencies in graph data by directly aggregating high-order structural information from nodes' multi-hop neighborhoods through a hop-count-aware mechanism.
The code is in the master branch.
